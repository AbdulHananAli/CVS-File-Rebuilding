# CVS-File-Rebuilding
The Repository introduces a problem with a file with unsorted text.
The task is detailed in the file named "CVS File Problem" (from PCWorkshops).
The example file is titled "file.txt".
The file path must be passable as args [].
The end result is to fix the file and print it as a single line on the command line.
The solution is in the file marked "file_fixer".
The "file_fixer" works if the file path being used as an input does not have any spaces as the single path will be read as two strings.
In such case pass the file path between quotation marks i.e. " ".
